sudo adduser tudi libvirt
sudo adduser tudi libvirt-qemu
```
## Install kubectl
```
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```
Verify kubectl installation
```
kubectl version --client
```
## Install Minikube
```
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 \
  && chmod +x minikube
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/
```
### Start Minikube
```
minikube start --driver=<driver_name> # if driver name is not given it would take default driver name
minikube status
```
### Create Kubernetes Deployment
What is a Kubernetes deployment?
A Deployment brings together ReplicaSets and Pods into a single process to deploy your application.

A ReplicaSet (improved version of a Replication Controller), works with the Kubernetes Master to manage Pods. If a Pod is removed/terminated/crashes/etc then the ReplicaSet will kill the Pod and recreate a new Pod to mantain the configured number of replicas.

A Pod is a container for containers. Most Pods have a 1-to-1 relationship between a Pod and a container. Pods included in a deployment share same label.
```
kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.10
```
#### Expose it as service
With a Deployment we have our Pods replicating properly within the cluster but we have yet to create a way for the world to reach our cluster/Pods. With a Service, a network interface to interact with our Pods is created.
```
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
# check it is running
kubectl get pod
```
Example:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service # a way for the outside world to reach the Pods
metadata:
  # any Pods with matching labels are included in this Service
  name: endpoints
spec:
  # Service ports
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
    - name: https
      port: 443
      targetPort: 8443
      protocol: TCP
  # It includes a LoadBalancer between Pods
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: kubernetes-series
```
#### Get URL for the service
```
minikube service hello-minikube --url
```
#### Access the URL
```
ssh -L 8080:192.168.39.139:32267 tudi@192.168.1.35
# 8080 - local port
# 192.168.39.139:32267 - URL where service is available
# tudi@192.168.1.35 - user at IP where Minikube is running
```
#### Delete the deployment
##### List resources in namespace
```
kubectl get pods --namespace default
```
##### Delete the service
```
kubectl delete services hello-minikube
```
##### In case deployed as deployment delete deployment
```
kubectl delete deploy hello-minikube 
```
### Stop Minikube
```
minikube stop
```
