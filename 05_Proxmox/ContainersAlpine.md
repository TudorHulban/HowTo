# Proxmox Containers: Alpine
Note: Ansible did not run on Alpine containers due to asking for password, although sudoers file on Alpine was updated.

## Connect to container
```bash
sudo pct enter 100
```
## Install openssh server
```bash
apk add openssh bash vim sudo # vi remains, must use vim <file>
/etc/init.d/sshd start # start the sshd service immediately and create configuration files:
rc-status              # list services to verify sshd is enabled:
rc-update add sshd     # add SSH at current run level
```
## Connect
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.9   # uses SSH key in intialization
```
